# Web App Coding Challenge Chat

The task is to refactor this web application with angular (Please ignore app.js and focus your efforts on the content of the "public" folder). Use bootstrap or any other UI library if you see fit.

## Real Time

FYI: The backend of this implementation publishes new chat messages with Pusher(https://pusher.com/) on the channel 'chat-messages' with the event 'new_message'. Use the key "be0cb4958ed00f849ac9" to establish a connection to our Pusher server.
